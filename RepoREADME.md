## Idea

**Dev Trove** is a Visual Studio Code extension that rewards users with coins based on the time they've spent coding. These coins can be used to open loot boxes and allow users to showcase their achievements to friends and colleagues.

## Visual Studio Code Documentation

You can find the extension on the Visual Studio Code marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).

## Stories

As a user of **Dev Trove**, you can look forward to the following features:

1. **See Your Token Balance**: Check the amount of tokens you've earned by coding.

2. **Open Loot Boxes**: Use your tokens to open loot boxes filled with exciting rewards.

3. **View Your Loot Collection**: Easily review all the loot items you've acquired.

4. **Favorite Your Loot**: Mark your favorite pieces of loot to show them off to your peers.

## Future Work

Our future plans for **Dev Trove** include the following features:

- **Web Interface for Team Management**: We aim to add a web interface for product managers to create development teams. Each developer will receive a team link and can sign in to the extension using that link. The web interface will provide a leaderboard of all developers on your team, enhancing collaboration and competition.

Thank you for your interest in **Dev Trove**. We look forward to your contributions and the exciting features we can build together!
